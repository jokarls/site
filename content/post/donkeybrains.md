In 2015 when Garmin launched the Connect IQ platform, I was eager to try it out. Me and a friend started an ambitious app project and we knew that we need a build server of some sort, to make sure we didn't mess things up for eachother. The solution back then was an old laptop in his basement running a Jenkins server. Since then I've learned how to use Docker and while starting up a new app project, I thougth this would be a good time to set up a propper CI pipeline.
